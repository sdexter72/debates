And while\r\ndigital humanists can be very explicit about the ethical positions\r\nembedded in their scholarship, pedagogy, and other academic labor, the\r\nsoftware we use can appear to be completely orthogonal&#x2013;neutral, if\r\nnot simply irrelevant&#x2013;to these concerns. \r\n\r\nOf course, some DHers do make software choices based on ethical\r\nconsiderations&#x2013;for example, perceiving and acting on a direct\r\nconnection between, on one hand, a felt scholarly imperative for\r\nsharing and transparency, and, on the other, their use and creation of\r\nopen-source software. At the same time, while\r\nfreely available “Web 2.0” technologies such as Twitter, Facebook, and\r\nGoogle Docs offer educators exciting opportunities to foster energetic\r\nforms of student collaboration, these tools deprive students of rights\r\nover their data and foster a passive, consumer-oriented relationship\r\ntoward technology. \r\n\r\nHow should we choose the technologies we use in our teaching and research?\r\nAs we increasingly integrate  digital technologies into our \r\npractice, we need a critical framework for analyzing the ethical and\r\nsocial implications of their use. That is, we must move this kind of ethical deliberation\r\nfrom the narrow scope of individual choice to a broader discussion of\r\nsoftware ethics within the digital humanities community.\r\n\r\nIn this piece, we  offer both tools and controversial positions:\r\n\r\n-   a primer on software ethics, especially the implications of “free\r\n    software,” “open-source” software, and proprietary software;\r\n\r\n-   an “environmental scan” of common DH software practices;\r\n\r\n-   recommendations for making more\r\n    ethically-informed software choices, including an on-ramp for\r\n    scholars and institutions who are more comfortable with incremental,\r\n    rather than wholesale, change;\r\n\r\n-   a call for funders to be explicit about software ethics in their\r\n    RFPs; and\r\n\r\n-   a vision for a digital humanities,\r\n    and an academy, which is fully conscious of the ethical implications\r\n    of the software it both produces and relies upon.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
