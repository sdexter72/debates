The digital humanities rely, fundamentally, on software. And while
digital humanists can be very explicit about the ethical positions
embedded in their scholarship, pedagogy, and other academic labor, the
software we use can appear to be completely orthogonal&#x2013;neutral, if
not simply irrelevant&#x2013;to these concerns. 

Of course, some DHers do make software choices based on ethical
considerations&#x2013;for example, perceiving and acting on a direct
connection between a felt scholarly imperative for sharing and transparency
and the use (or production) of open-source software. Yet we
believe there is a pressing need to move this kind of ethical
deliberation from the narrow (neoliberal, popsicle) scope of
individual choice to a broader discussion of software ethics within
the digital humanities community.

  So, in this piece, we intend to offer both tools and
controversial positions:

-   a primer on software ethics, especially the implications of “free
    software,” “open-source” software, and proprietary software

-   an “environmental scan” of common DH software practices

-   some recommendations for scholars who wish to make more
    ethically-informed software choices, including an on-ramp for
    scholars and institutions who are more comfortable with incremental,
    rather than wholesale, change

-   a call for DH funders to be explicit about software ethics in their
    RFPs

-   a vision (and this is the debate-able bit) for a digital humanities,
    and an academy, which is fully conscious of the ethical implications
    of the software it both produces and relies on.

A significant stream of digital humanities discourse stakes out an
array of ethical positions (which we fully endorse) relating to the
practice of digital humanities within and beyond the academy: we need
to be more transparent about the labor practices and economies of
reputation undergirding our work; we need to communicate more
effective with the general public and with scholars in other
disciplines, in order to address pressing societal problems in
new/anced ways. We need to share our tools—our code, our data—with
others, in order both to support the reproducibility of our results
and to allow our community to stand on each other’s shoulders. We need
to transform the increasingly corporate academy.

 For example, many times free software is used for
analysis but data is not shared which prevents confirmarory analysis
or challenge.
